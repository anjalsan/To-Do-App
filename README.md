## Task

1. Home Screen
	- Has two tabs: first one with a list of active todos and the second with a list of completed todos
	- Each active todo item can be marked as completed (using a checkbox or any similar widget).
2. Add Todo Screen
	- For creating a new active todo item.

   Notes:
	- Each todo item consists of a title (mandatory), description (optional) and a reminder time (optional).
	- If the reminder time is set, the app should display a notification at the specified time if the todo item is still active
	- Use RxJava for all asynchronous operations
	- Use Room for managing local storage
	- Architect the app for code clarity and scalability (in terms of adding new features). Document the architecture properly.
	- minSdkVersion should be 16
	- Please use Java, not Kotlin (sorry!)
	- Show your ui skills
	
## Libraries used on the sample project:
	
 - AppCompat, CardView and DesignLibrary
 - Data binding
 - RxJava, RxBinding
 - Room Persistence Library
 - Architecture Components for Lifecycle, LiveData and Lifecycle classes.
 
## Architecture

In this app, I'm following MVVMâ€Š Architecture(Model View ViewModel) with Some Android Architecture Components Like ViewModel, LiveData and Room.
Here I'm using Room for all DB related stuff. in Room, the database instance contained in a ViewModel. it contains all the data needed for the App. I wrap the list of to-do items inside LiveData, so that the Activity can observe changes and update UI accordingly.
RecyclerView Adapter of Todo item using data binding for each of its items. and there is a ViewModel Class(ItemTodoViewModel) for communicating with View and Model.
